# 3D CRS Transformation Resources

[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://uw-cryo.github.io/3D_CRS_Transformation_Resources/)

A centralized repository for resources, documentation and code samples to help the community navigate the confusing, complex, but very important topic of 3D coordinate reference system (CRS) transformations when combining datasets for precise geodetic analysis.

This repository was initially created for an improptu community tutorial session led by David Shean and Scott Henderson at the 2023 UW/NASA [ICESat-2 Hackweek event](https://icesat-2-2023.hackweek.io/).

We are continuing to review and update materials, including new recipes and examples for commonly used 3D datasets. The best way to navigate the material is via the Jupyter Book website (linked with the button above).

## Running code examples
If you want to execute code examples, we recommend [pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for managing the Python evironment:

```
git clone https://github.com/uw-cryo/3D_CRS_Transformation_Resources.git
pixi shell
```
